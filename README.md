# Overview

This project was made to learn how to use a database from vscode.

customer writes directly to a database named practise on firestore that stores the complaints in a table which stores a name, a complaint, and a timestamp.

It uses a simple self rated complaint system for customers to make complaints, then allows a worker to review and edit the list of complaints.
